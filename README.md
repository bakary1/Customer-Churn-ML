# Customer Churn Predicton

Customer Churn Prediction
Customer churn, the rate at which customers discontinue their engagement with a company's products or services, is a critical concern for businesses in all industries. High customer churn can lead to a significant loss in revenue and profitability for a company. In this project, I aim to address this business problem by leveraging machine learning techniques to try and predict customer churn.

The dataset used for this analysis was collected from Kaggle and centers around a teleco company. More information about the dataset can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/blastchar/telco-customer-churn
